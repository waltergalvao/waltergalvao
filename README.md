### Before you look further  
  
If you are looking at my GitHub to assess my skills... all my code is on GitLab private repositories ðŸ˜…  
  
I invite you to look at me career trajectory instead, look at linked.com/in/wbgneto  

### What you will find
  
All projects you`ll find here, were just college projects.  
  
Except for https://github.com/wbgneto/jira-better-estimates, that I made to help my team at Optix.
