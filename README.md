### Before you look further  
  
If you are looking at my GitHub to assess my skills... all my code is on GitLab private repositories ðŸ˜…  
  
I invite you to look at my career trajectory instead, look at https://linkedin.com/in/wbgneto  

### What you will find
  
Basically just college projects.  
  
Except for https://github.com/wbgneto/jira-better-estimates, which I made to help my team at Optix.
